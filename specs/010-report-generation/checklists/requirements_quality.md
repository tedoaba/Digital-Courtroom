# Requirements Quality Checklist: Final Report Generation

**Purpose**: Validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of the report generation requirements.
**Created**: 2026-02-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

Note: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 - Are the exact visual properties (e.g., color coding for scores, font for code blocks) defined or intentionally deferred? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 - Is the content of the "Executive Summary" specified beyond being a "synthesis of findings"? [Completeness, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are the specific metadata fields for the report header (Date, Hash, Version) explicitly listed in the functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Contract §1]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 - Is the term "Professional, human-readable" quantified with specific formatting standards? [Clarity, Spec §Objective]
- [ ] CHK005 - Is the character limit for "Large Evidence Content" defined with a specific threshold (e.g., 2000 characters)? [Clarity, Ambiguity, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK006 - Is the format of "file-level instructions" (e.g., filename:line, diff format) specified? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 - Do the header naming conventions in the Functional Requirements align perfectly with the Interface Contract? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002 vs Contract]
- [ ] CHK008 - Is the "Checksum Log" requirement consistent across its role as an embedded block and a sibling file? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 - Is "Deterministic output" defined in measurable terms (e.g., byte-for-byte identity)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK010 - Can the "resolvability" of evidence citations be objectively verified by a script? [Measurability, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario & Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 - Does the spec define the report structure when 0 evidence is found for a criterion? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK012 - Are requirements specified for handling multiple audits of the same repo in the same directory (e.g., timestamping folders)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK013 - Is the behavior defined for when a `dissent_summary` exists but all judges actually agree on the final score? [Conflict, Edge Case]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK014 - Are the security constraints for "Safe file I/O" (e.g., sanitization of repo_name in path) explicitly required? [Security, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK015 - Is the "Cross-platform path stability" requirement accompanied by a specific set of target OS versions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Items are numbered sequentially for easy reference
- References to `[Spec §...]` indicate where the current requirement is located.
- `[Gap]` indicates a missing requirement area discovered during analysis.
