# DevOps Rigor Checklist: DevOps Hardening — Containerization, Automation & CI/CD

**Purpose**: Formal production-grade gate to validate the quality, security, and completeness of DevOps requirements.
**Created**: 2026-02-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are the specific versions of `hadolint` and `pip-audit` required for the CI environment defined? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 Are the specific secret keys required for the GitHub Actions environment (e.g., `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`) explicitly listed in the Functional Requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK003 Does the spec define the required permissions (Read-only vs Read-Write) for each Docker volume mapping? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the behavior for the GitHub Actions pipeline defined if the Docker build succeeds but the container fails to initialize? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the "python:3.12-slim" base image requirement pinned to a specific minor version or digest to ensure reproducibility? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK006 Are the specific failure messages for each "Pre-flight Check" (e.g., missing `.env`) specified to ensure clear guidance? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK007 Are the severity levels (e.g., Error vs Warning) for `hadolint` that trigger a "fail-fast" termination explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "high code quality" in Story 3 quantified with specific, measurable tool-based metrics? [Clarity, Spec §Story 3]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Is the `rc/*` branch trigger logic consistent with the project's documented release candidate naming strategy? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK010 Do the volume mappings in the Docker Requirements align with the directories checked in the Makefile Pre-flight checks? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004 vs §FR-007]

## Scenario & Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are requirements defined for the "no-docker" scenario (e.g., when a developer wants to run checks without the container daemon)? [Coverage, Alternate Flow]
- [ ] CHK012 Does the spec define the recovery or cleanup requirements for failed Docker builds in the CI environment? [Coverage, Recovery Flow]
- [ ] CHK013 Are requirements specified for handling architecture-specific Docker builds (e.g., ARM64 vs AMD64)? [Coverage, Non-Functional]

## Measurability & Success Criteria

- [ ] CHK014 Is the image size limit of 400MB (SC-002) defined as a hard requirement in the Functional Requirements or just a Success Criterion? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK015 Can the "100% pass rate" (SC-003) be objectively verified against specific tool outputs in the CI logs? [Measurability, Spec §SC-003]

## Notes

- This checklist serves as a **Production Gate** (R rigor).
- Focus areas include **CI/CD YAML security**, **Docker isolation**, and **Makefile abstraction**.
- Items are designed to test the **quality of written requirements** to ensure implementation is "Ironclad".
