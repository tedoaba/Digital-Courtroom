  <strong>Transforming Software Governance through Adversarial Multi-Agent Swarms</strong>
</p>

In a world where AI-generated code outpaces human review capacity, the bottleneck of software delivery shifts from **generation** to **governance**. The **Automaton Auditor** is a production-grade, hierarchical multi-agent system built on **LangGraph** designed to automate the rigorous process of architectural review and code auditing.

## 🏛️ The Digital Courtroom Philosophy

Instead of relying on a single, monolithic LLM prompt prone to hallucinations and "vibe-based" grading, this system treats code validation as a formal legal proceeding. It operates on the **Dialectical Model (Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis)**:

1.  **Forensic Analysis (The Detectives):** Objectively verifying the existence and structure of code artifacts. No opinions allowed.
2.  **Nuanced Judgment (The Judges):** Applying complex, persona-driven rubrics to interpret the evidence from conflicting viewpoints.
3.  **Deterministic Verdict (The Supreme Court):** A purely Pythonic rule-engine that synthesizes a final ruling based on the "Rule of Law"—not the "Vibe of the Model."

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system executes through a strictly layered **StateGraph** architecture, ensuring deterministic synchronization and parallel throughput.

### **Layer 1: The Detective Layer (Parallel Fan-Out)**

Specialized agents collect raw evidence based on strict forensic protocols.

- **🔍 RepoInvestigator:** Uses AST parsing and Git forensic analysis to verify state rigor and graph wiring.
- **📄 DocAnalyst:** Cross-references technical documentation against repository reality to detect "Concept Hallucinations."
- **👁️ VisionInspector:** Analyzes architectural diagrams via multi-modal LLMs to verify structural integrity.

### **Layer 2: The Judicial Layer (The Dialectical Bench)**

Three independent personas analyze the **same evidence** for every rubric criterion:

- **⚖️ The Prosecutor (Critical):** Hunts for gaps, security flaws, and technical debt.
- **🛡️ The Defense (Optimistic):** Highlights creative intent, engineering struggle, and "Spirit of the Law."
- **🛠️ The Tech Lead (Pragmatic):** Focuses on maintainability, scalability, and functional viability.

### **Layer 3: The Supreme Court (Deterministic Synthesis)**

The **Chief Justice** node resolves conflicts using hardcoded Python rules:

- **Security Supremacy:** Confirmed vulnerabilities cap scores regardless of effort.
- **Fact Supremacy:** Forensic evidence always overrules judicial opinion.
- **Variance Re-evaluation:** High disagreement among judges triggers an automated re-audit.

## 🛡️ Production Hardening (Operation Ironclad Swarm)

The system is built for production-grade reliability and forensic rigor through the following hardening features:

- **🔒 Hardened Vault**: All sensitive credentials (API keys, repo tokens) are stored in an **AES-256 encrypted vault** (Fernet).
- **📦 Isolated Sandbox**: Detectives execute all Git and file operations within a resource-constrained `SandboxEnvironment`. It enforces strict limits (**512MB RAM, 1 CPU core**) and uses a cross-platform watchdog to prevent tool escapes.
- **🧬 Evidence Hashing**: Every piece of evidence is cryptographically linked in a **sequential SHA-256 hash chain**, ensuring the final report is verifiable and tamper-proof.
- **🔌 Circuit Breakers**: Built-in **Circuit Breaker** patterns (3-failure threshold, 30s reset) protect against external API outages.
- **⚖️ Redundant Judges**: Implements a **Leader Election** pattern for judicial nodes to handle rate limits or regional outages seamlessly.
- **📊 Live TUI Dashboard**: Real-time terminal monitoring of graph execution, node health, and judicial consensus metrics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **Prerequisites**

- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Fast Python Package Manager)
- API Keys for OpenAI/Gemini and a [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) account for tracing.

### **Installation**

Clone the repository and install dependencies using `uv`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tedoaba/Digital-Courtroom.git
cd Digital-Courtroom
uv sync
```

Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Generate a **Vault Key** for AES-256 encryption:

```bash
# Generate a key and add it to your .env as COURTROOM_VAULT_KEY
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

## 🐳 Containerized Execution (Docker)

For high-security production environments or CI/CD pipelines, you should execute the auditor via the hardened Docker container.

### 1. Build the Image

```bash
make docker-build
```

### 2. Network Configuration (Ollama Users)

If you are using a local Ollama instance for Vision or Judicial models, you must allow the container to reach your host machine:

1.  **Update `.env`**: Set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434`.
2.  **Enable Host Access**: Set the Windows/Linux environment variable `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` and restart the Ollama application.

### 3. Running in Docker

The Docker container automatically mounts your local folders:

- **`reports/`** (Read-Only): Put your input PDF specs here.
- **`audit/`** (Read-Write): Your generated reports will appear here on your host machine.

#### **Standard Audit**

```bash
make docker-run REPO=<REPO_URL> SPEC=reports/<YOUR_SPEC>.pdf
```

#### **Interactive TUI Dashboard**

```bash
make docker-ui REPO=<REPO_URL> SPEC=reports/<YOUR_SPEC>.pdf
```

### **Running the Auditor**

#### 1. Standard Execution

Run a full audit with default settings:

```bash
uv run python -m src.main --repo <REPO_URL> --spec <PDF_PATH>
```

#### 2. With Real-time Dashboard (Recommended)

Enable the high-fidelity TUI (Terminal User Interface) to visualize the swarm in action:

```bash
uv run python -m src.cli audit --repo <REPO_URL> --spec <PDF_PATH>
```

#### 3. Advanced Configuration

Customize the scoring rubric or view the active system configuration:

```bash
# Run with a custom rubric
uv run python -m src.cli audit \
  --repo https://github.com/user/project \
  --spec specs/feature-v1.pdf \
  --rubric rubric/strict_rubric.json \
  --dashboard

# View hardened configuration status
uv run python -m src.cli config
```

```

## 📄 Formal Output Schema

To guarantee machine-readable compliance and seamless integrations with external dashboards, all final audits strictly conform to a **Pydantic formal output schema**.
You can re-generate the most up-to-date schema via:

```bash
uv run python -c "import json; from src.state import AuditReport; print(json.dumps(AuditReport.model_json_schema(), indent=2))" > schema.json
```

The exact schema definition is validated rigorously on every run and guaranteed to conform to property constraints.

## 📈 Observability & Forensics

Every execution is a "Forensic Event." You can audit the results through:

1.  **LangSmith**: Deep-dive into every node's `state_diff` and model prompt/response.
2.  **TUI Dashboard**: Live performance metrics and node status tracking.
3.  **Audit Trail**: A `run_audit_trail.json` is generated for every run, containing the full sequential hash chain of evidence.
